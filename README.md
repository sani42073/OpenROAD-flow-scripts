# **PPA Improvements of riscv32i and ibex using OpenROAD Flow Scripts** #  
&nbsp;


## **1. Introduction** ##
This repository contains all the source codes of OpenRoad flow scripts along with the modified scripts to obtain better PPA.   

Using the ORFS flow we are able to run the flow from RTL to GDS within a very short run time. After exploring different stages we found some modifications which can improve the overall PPA. Here, we described some changes in parameters and scripts which can improve the performance of the riscv32i and ibex design while keeping the design DRC free.

## **2. Tool Flow** ##
This flow chat represent the RTL to GDS flow using OpenRoad flow script.

## **3. Challenges** ##

* Using multiple types of VT cell on synthesis.
* Placing the macro in proper position to maintain better PPA.
* Finding proper pin placement.
* Maintaining proper cluster size and diameter to gain best clock skew.
* Finding the appropriate buffer or clock inverter cell to improve timing.
* High routing congestions while increasing clock frequency.
* Distributing the metal layers properly for the clock tree, signal nets and pins to get better PPA without negative slack.
* Adjust the global routing layer properly to minimize routing congestion.
* Keep the design DRC free while increasing the clock frequency.
* Maintaining or keeping minimum DRV. 

## **4. Observation** ##

* In synthesis, yosys tool cannot handle multiple types of library files. So, we arenot able to use different type of VT cells in the design. We can only use the RVT or LVT or SLVT cell.
* In the library file there were no clock buffer cells so we had to use the normal buffer cell and clock inverter for CTS.
* While we changed the macro positions in our design for some macros, tool wasnâ€™t able to route properly due to high routing congestion for some of the macro placements.
* While increasing the clock frequency we found some DRC violations (for example minimum spacing violation) in our routing stage.

## **5. What is Do-able?** ##

### **5.1 Synthesis** ###

* Using SLVT or LVT or RVT cell
* Using different optimization switch and attribute.


### **5.2 Floorplan** ###

* Changing the macro placement.
* Changing the pin placement and Pin metal layer.

### **5.3 CTS** ###

* Changing cluster size and diameter.
* Changing CTS cell.
* Defining clock routing layer.
* Adding setup and hold slack margin

### **5.4 Route** ###

* Adjust the global routing layer .
* Changing metal routing layer.

## **6. Work Done** ##

### **6.1 Synthesis:** ###
we changed the PDK config file and used the SLVT cell for our design to improve the performance. Because SLVT has a lower delay than other VT cell.

`./flow/platforms/asap7/config.mk` 
&nbsp;
#### **Design Specific Changes on synthesis stage:** ####
We used SLVT cell for both riscV32i and ibex design.

### **6.2 Floor Plan:** ###

* While increasing frequency we faced some Metal spacing related DRC violation which was solved by changing the metal layer of the pins.This also allowed us to maintain the routing congestion.

##### **For riscV32i:** #####
For riscV32i design we used M4 (which is default value set in PDK config file) and M7 (edited on design config file) metal layer for horizontal and vertical Pin layer. 

![fig. 3](./Images/2_pinlayer_riscv.png)  
`./flow/designs/asap7/riscv32i/config.mk`
##### **For ibex:** #####
For ibex design we used default settings which is M4 and M5 metal layer for horizontal and vertical Pin layer.  

### **6.3 CTS:** ###

* We changed clock routing layer for our design to ensure proper use or routing layer.

![fig. 5](./Images/3_clk_routing_layer.png)  
`./flow/scripts/cts.tcl`

* We Also added remove_buffer and repair_design command to remove all buffer tree and rebuild the clock tree again to get better clock skew.

`./flow/scripts/cts.tcl`

* We also changed cluster size and diameter to improve the clock skew.

![fig. 7](./Images/5_cluster.png)  
`./flow/scripts/cts.tcl`

* We added CTS  cell list for our design to improve the clock skew.

![fig. 10](./Images/7_cts_stage_design_config_ibex.png)  
`./flow/designs/asap7/ibex/config.mk`

### **6.4 Route:** ###
* We modified the global layer adjustment attribute in our design to maintain proper routing congestion and proper uses of routing resources and which lead to better PPA. 

![fig. 11](./Images/8_routing_layer_adjustment.png)  
`./flow/scripts/global_route.tcl`

* We also modified the signal routing layer to maintain lower routing congestion and keep the routing DRC free and get better PPA.

## **7. Conclusion** ##
By multiple test runs using various resources available, we were able to come up with ideas that were able to meet the design goals of the contest which was to achieve best performance (Best fmax) without any timing violation (0 wns).**For riscV32i design we were able to achieve 771.01 MHz frequency and for ibex we were able to achieve 769.23 MHz frequency with 0 wns. Higher frequency was achievable but in that case DRV (Design Rule Violations) violation will increase and so we didn't increase the frequency after 771.01 MHz**. Here is the comparison of the base run using the default flow script of OpenRoad (on 625MHZ for riscV32i and 568.18 MHz for ibex) and the completed run using all our modifications ( on 777 MHz for riscV32i design and 769.63 MHz for ibex design).

##### **Note:** #####
* After cloning the repository, If ORFS is already built locally in your machine then you may need to source `setup.env.sh` file from that directory.
* And, after that you need to select the design in Makefile and run "make finish" command to run the flow.
